A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of reaction without modifying the energy of either the reactants or products. The process by which a catalyst works is called *catalysis*.

Catalysts may be classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous, depending on the conditions under which they act:
 
 - Homogeneous catalysis takes place in a single phase; for instance, when the catalyst is dissolved in solution along with the reactants.
 - Heterogeneous catalysis takes place at the interface between two or more phases; for instance, a dissolved reactant being acted upon by an undissolved metal catalyst.
