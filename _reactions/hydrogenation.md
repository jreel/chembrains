Hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of a pair of hydrogen atoms to a molecule containing a double or triple bond, most often an [alkene][]. The process utilizes [molecular hydrogen][H2] ([H<sub>2</sub>][H2] in the presence of a metal catalyst such as nickel, palladium or [platinum][Pt]. A catalyst is required for the reaction to be usable; non-catalytic hydrogenation takes place only at very high temperatures.


An important characteristic of hydrogenation is that hydrogen addition occurs with [<i>syn</i> addition][syn], as demonstrated by the diagram below. Note that although there is usually an equal likelihood of H<sub>2</sub> adding to either face, the presence of [large, bulky substituents][sterics] on the substrate may block addition to one face, causing the less hindered face to be favored.
