Hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of a pair of hydrogen atoms to a molecule containing a double or triple bond, most often an [alkene]({{ url.alkene }}). The process utilizes [molecular hydrogen]({{ url.H2 }}) ([H<sub>2</sub>]({{ url.H2 }})) in the presence of a metal catalyst such as nickel, palladium or [platinum]({{ url.Pt }}). A catalyst is required for the reaction to be usable; non-catalytic hydrogenation takes place only at very high temperatures.
