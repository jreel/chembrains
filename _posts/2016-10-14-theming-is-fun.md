I'm taking a crack at theming this Jekyll stuff. Found some decently good looking, minimalist themes based on the [Poole theme](http://getpoole.com/), and trying to combine my favorite bits from each. Not sure why GitHub Pages doesn't seem to be propagating the changes... writing this blog post in hopes that it will "force" an update.
