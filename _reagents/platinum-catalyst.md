Platinum is used as the [catalyst][] in [hydrogenation][] reactions, [reducing][] [pi bonds][] in the presence of [hydrogen gas][]. It is typically listed in the reagents as **Pt** or **Pt/C**. The reaction may be similarly catalyzed by other metals, including:
 
 - [palladium][Pd] (Pd or Pd/C)
 - nickel (Ni) 
 - ruthenium (Ru or Ru/C)
 - rhodium (Rh or Rh/C)

Platinum (as well as the other metal catalysts listed above) is a [heterogeneous][] catalyst. Hydrogen gas is adsorbed onto the metal surface, followed by the [substrate][] (usually an [alkene][]). The [addition reaction][] takes place in a <i>[syn][]</i> fashion.
