Palladium adsorbed on carbon (Pd/C) is often used as the [catalyst][] in [hydrogenation][] reactions, [reducing][] [pi bonds][] in the presence of [hydrogen gas][]. Adsorbing the metal onto carbon (in the form of very porous charcoal) provides a much larger surface area, increasing the rate of reaction. Hydrogenation reactions may be similarly catalyzed by other metals, including:
 
 - [platinum][Pt] (Pt or Pt/C)
 - nickel (Ni) 
 - ruthenium (Ru or Ru/C)
 - rhodium (Rh or Rh/C)

Palladium (as well as the other metal catalysts listed above) is a [heterogeneous][] catalyst. Hydrogen gas is adsorbed onto the metal surface, followed by the [substrate][] (usually an [alkene][]). The [addition reaction][] takes place in a <i>[syn][]</i> fashion.
