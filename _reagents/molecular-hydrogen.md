Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), also known as hydrogen gas, is used for the [reduction][] of [alkenes][], [alkynes][], and other [functional groups][] containing a [pi bond][]. This [addition reaction][] is known as [hydrogenation][] and requires a metal [catalyst][], such as [Pt][], [Pd/C][Pd], etc.
