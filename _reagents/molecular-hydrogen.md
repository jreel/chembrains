Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), also known as hydrogen gas, is used for the [reduction][] of [alkenes][], [alkynes][], and other [functional groups][] containing a [pi bond][]. This [addition reaction][] is known as [hydrogenation][] and requires a metal [catalyst][], such as [platinum][Pt] (Pt), [palladium][Pd] (Pd/C), nickel (Ni), etc.
